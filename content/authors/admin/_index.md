awards:
  - title: Excellent Student Scholarship
    date: '2025-09-15' 
    awarder: Beijing Institute of Technology
    summary: |
      Awarded for achieving the **top academic rank (1st place)** in the class during the 2024-2025-2nd semester. This scholarship recognizes exceptional academic performance and dedication to studies.

  - title: Finalist ([MCM/ICM](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm)) <br> Top 1.96% of 27,456 teams worldwide
    date: '2025-05-09'
    awarder: Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP)
    summary: |
      This study quantifies the ecological impact of converting forests to farmland by focusing on nitrogen cycling, a key indicator of ecosystem health. We developed three dynamic models using modified Lotka-Volterra equations: a **Forest Ecosystem Nitrogen Cycle Model (FENCM)**, an **Agricultural Ecosystem Nitrogen Cycle Model (AENCM)** incorporating human interventions, and a more complex **Agricultural Ecosystem-Food Web-Nitrogen Cycle Model (AE-FW-NCM)**. Our comparative analysis of these models highlights the trade-offs between agricultural yield, biodiversity, and sustainability, and concludes with practical recommendations for farmers. The TeX source and numerical simulation code are [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/LUKEQ420/MCM-ICM-2025-E-Nitrogen-Cycling-Model).

  - title: Excellent Thesis Prize
    date: '2024-06-30'
    awarder: Beijing Institute of Technology
    summary: |
      This prize was awarded for my undergraduate thesis, which developed a novel **Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework** to model and solve complex task termination problems. This research focused on safety-critical systems operating under hybrid uncertainty of both system lifetime and task duration. The findings from this thesis were significant and formed the basis of my first-author publication in the JCR Q1 journal, **Computers Industrial Engineering**.

  - title: Meritorious Winner ([MCM/ICM](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm)) <br> Top 9.29% of 20,858 teams worldwide
    date: '2023-05-01'
    awarder: Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP)
    summary: |
      To address the increasing frequency of droughts, we developed a series of mathematical models to predict the viability of plant communities under various climate scenarios. Our approach included a **Soil-Water Model (SWM)** based on Darcy's Law and an **Improved Population Lotka-Volterra Model (PLVM)** that accounts for species competition. We combined these into a comprehensive **Plant Soil Moisture Competition Model (PSMCM)** to solve real-world problems related to drought mitigation and sustainable land-use planning. Our study provides valuable insights into the composition of drought-resistant plant communities and can assist in conservation efforts in arid regions.

## About Me
I have completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and am now pursuing a second degree in Computer Science at the Beijing Institute of Technology.

My academic interests are centered at the intersection of Bayesian statistics and modern reinforcement learning. Through my prior work in reliability engineering and state representation learning, I have developed a strong interest in advancing the computational scalability of Bayesian inference for complex systems and in creating more expressive models for latent dynamics. I am passionate about developing methods that are both theoretically sound and practically applicable. Currently, I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions and welcome opportunities for academic collaboration.
