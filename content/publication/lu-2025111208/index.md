abstract: The lifetime distribution of engineering systems typically demonstrates
  significant heterogeneity, influenced by various factors such as material quality,
  manufacturing variations, usage intensity, and environmental conditions. Meanwhile,
  the distribution of random task durations can vary considerably, depending on resource
  availability, task complexity, and external disruptions. Accurately characterizing
  these heterogeneities is vital for improving the overall operational efficiency
  of engineering systems. This study explores optimal task termination decisions that
  effectively address the hybrid uncertainty stemming from the diverse distributions
  of system lifetimes and task durations. Utilizing a Bayesian statistical learning
  framework, the study models the uncertainties associated with random task durations
  and system lifetimes through unobserved distribution parameters. Bayesian parameter
  updating techniques are employed to derive posterior distributions for these parameters,
  informed by observed data collected during task executions regarding task durations
  and system lifetimes. By iteratively refining these parameters, the study dynamically
  determines the optimal task termination time. Furthermore, the properties of the
  optimal task termination decisions are investigated within a Markov Decision Process
  framework. A series of numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical
  findings and highlight the practical implications of the proposed approach. The
  experimental results reveal a potential cost reduction of up to 45.11% compared
  to existing policies, emphasizing the efficacy and of the proposed methodology.
